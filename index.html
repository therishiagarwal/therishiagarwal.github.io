<br>I am a 3rd-year B.Tech student at <a href="https://www.bennett.edu.in/">Bennett University</a>, specializing in Cloud Computing. My academic journey is focused on building solutions that integrate machine learning, cloud infrastructure, and real-time applications. I have a strong interest in creating scalable, cloud-based architectures and solving complex technical challenges, also in the field of AI-driven safety analytics and IoT-based systems.<br><br>

In addition to my studies, I’ve been involved in projects that blend artificial intelligence with mobile and cloud computing solutions, including the development of an SOS app for women’s safety and other university projects.<br><br>

When I’m not coding or studying, I enjoy playing outdoor games and socializing with friends.<br><br>

<!-- 
<br>I am a Research Scientist in the AI Speech team at <a href="https://research.facebook.com/">Meta AI</a>,
where I build robust on-device speech recognition models. My research interests lie in the application
of machine learning methods for speech and language tasks.<br><br>

<!-- Previously, I was a PhD student at <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>, working in the <a
	href="https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/">Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP)</a>, advised by <a
	href="https://clsp.wse.jhu.edu/faculty-pages/sanjeev/">Sanjeev Khudanpur</a> and <a
	href="http://www.danielpovey.com/">Dan Povey</a>. I was a JHU-Amazon AI2AI fellow, a Fred Jelinek fellow, and
an IEEE Rising Star in Signal Processing.<br><br> -->

<!-- I have interned in the speech groups at Microsoft (in 2021) and Meta (in 2022). <br><br> -->

<!--  My bachelor thesis was on deep learning methods
for relation extraction in clinical text, supervised by <a href="http://www.iitg.ac.in/anand.ashish/index.html">Ashish
